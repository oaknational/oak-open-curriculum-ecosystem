/**
 * The D1 verdict core for `agent-tools pr state`: resolve one compound
 * {@link PrStateReading} to exactly one verdict from the CLOSED verdict set
 * (`state-types.ts`). Pure and total — no IO; the gh seam lives in
 * `state-gh.ts`, the per-reviewer leg machine in `reviewer-legs.ts`, the
 * settlement half in `settlement.ts`. The set and precedence execute the
 * pr-lifecycle SKILL's review-round state machine (the SKILL stays
 * canonical); per-check verdicts travel BY NAME, never positionally (the
 * #437 cure — fixtures in `states.unit.test.ts`).
 *
 * Four states extend the plan's 11-state enumeration, each typed honesty
 * over a lie: `CLOSED` (a closed-unmerged PR gets a refusal, never a
 * mis-mapped healthy verdict), `SETTLING-QUIET-WINDOW` (all legs settled but
 * the more-than-10-minute async-lag window since the latest tip-bound review
 * has not elapsed — SKILL item 4; declaring SETTLE-READY inside the window
 * recreates the bot-round-still-composing hole),
 * `SILENT-WAIT-RUNS-UNREADABLE` (an unreadable or truncated run surface
 * never asserts deadness), and `BEHIND-BASE` (a stale base never reads
 * settled — the founding BEHIND-stall class).
