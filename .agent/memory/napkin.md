## Session: 2026-02-12 — Public Release Readiness Plan

### Context

- Repo going public within 1-2 sprints
- SDKs and MCP tooling may become public npm packages
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### What Was Done

- Created public release readiness plan at `.agent/plans/semantic-search/active/public-release-readiness.plan.md`
- 6 workstreams: secrets remediation (CRITICAL), licence/legal, package.json standardisation, documentation overhaul, GitHub config, publication dry run
- Updated navigation docs (README.md, roadmap.md) to link to the new plan

### Key Findings from Audit

- **CRITICAL: Real API keys in tracked files**: `.agent/experience/the-api-key-revelation.md` has actual NOTION_API_KEY and OAK_API_KEY values. `.agent/plans/archive/completed/mcp-oauth-implementation-plan.archive.md` has Clerk dev credentials.
- **No LICENSE file**: README references `[LICENSE](LICENSE)` but file doesn't exist. MIT declared in package.json but no licence text.
- **No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Referenced implicitly in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **CHANGELOG.md is from wrong repo**: Contains oak-notion-mcp entries, not oak-mcp-ecosystem
- **9 of 12 workspaces missing `author`**: Only stdio, curriculum-sdk, and search-sdk have it
- **All 12 workspaces missing `homepage` and `bugs`**
- **5 workspaces missing `license` field**
- **Most packages missing `private: true`**: Only root, streamable-http, and search-cli are marked private
- **CONTRIBUTING.md stale**: Node.js 22+ (should be 24.x), references non-existent ErrorHandler class and CONTRIBUTORS.md, wrong quality gate commands, says E2E needs API keys (should use mocks)
- **No GitHub issue/PR templates, no Dependabot**
- **Stale `.github/workflows/sdk-docs-disabled.yml.bak`** tracked
- **packages/core/oak-eslint has no README**

### Patterns to Remember

- Always audit for secrets before making any repo public
- `rg` searches with `2>/dev/null` needed due to stale `.cursorignore` references
- npm package.json person field: object form (`{ name, url }`) is preferred over string form
- Scoped packages (`@oaknational/`) default to restricted on npm; need `publishConfig.access: "public"` to publish publicly
- Plans must update README, roadmap, AND session prompt for discoverability

## Session: 2026-02-12 — Transcript 451 + Test Strategy Remediation Plan

### Context

- Investigation of `/lessons/{lesson}/transcript` upstream behaviour
- Found upstream changed from 500/404 to HTTP 451 for unavailable transcripts
- Audited all E2E tests for testing strategy compliance
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### Key Findings

- **Upstream 451**: French/German/Spanish transcripts now return HTTP 451 (was 500/404). Some maths lessons also return 451. Body says `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` despite 451 status.
- **classifyHttpError is GENERATED**: Lives in `type-gen/typegen/error-types/generate-error-types.ts`. Fix must go in the generator template per schema-first directive. Do NOT edit `sdk-error-types.ts` directly.
- **Notion MCP E2E test**: `apps/oak-notion-mcp/e2e-tests/server.e2e.test.ts` makes real network calls to Notion API. Clear violation of testing strategy.
- **built-server E2E test**: Uses `fetch()` to localhost — network IO violation. Must be refactored to use in-process supertest with DI, NOT relabelled as smoke test (that's the lazy option).
- **process.env mutation**: 4 streamable-http E2E tests mutate `process.env` despite using in-process `createApp()`. The correct pattern is `createApp({ runtimeConfig })`.

### What Was Done

- Created remediation plan at `.agent/plans/semantic-search/active/transcript-451-test-doc-remediation.plan.md`
- 4 workstreams: 451 handling (generator fix), E2E test compliance, documentation updates, directive compliance sweep

### Mistakes Made (and Corrected)

- Grep tool consistently failed due to missing `.cursorignore` files in `apps/oak-open-curriculum-semantic-search/`. Had to use shell `rg` with `2>/dev/null` instead.
- Initially searched for `search_vtt` literally — the term does not exist in the codebase. The actual entity is `/lessons/{lesson}/transcript` which returns `{ transcript, vtt }`.
- Fenced code blocks without language specifiers fail markdownlint (MD040). Always specify language even for file paths (use inline backticks instead).
- First draft of plan was orphaned — no parent docs linked to it. Plans must always update README, roadmap, and session prompt. A document nobody can find is a document that doesn't exist.
- `process.env.X = ` with trailing space inside backticks triggers MD038 (spaces inside code span). Rephrase to avoid trailing spaces in inline code.
- Blank line between two blockquotes triggers MD028. Use `>` with empty line (`> \n >`) to continue a single blockquote.

### Patterns to Remember

- `rg` in shell with `2>/dev/null` bypasses cursorignore errors that block the Grep tool
- `curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}"` is the quick way to test upstream API status codes
- Generator templates in `type-gen/typegen/` are the source of truth for anything in `src/types/generated/`
- E2E tests: STDIO IO allowed, network IO forbidden. Smoke tests: all IO allowed, NO mocks.
- **NEVER reclassify a test to a weaker category just to permit IO** — refactor the test to use DI instead. Relabelling is lazy; DI is architecturally correct.
- Naming: `test:*` for vitest tests, `smoke:*` for standalone tsx scripts. Do not invent new conventions.
- Plan documents must be **discoverable**: link from parent README, roadmap, AND session prompt
- Plan documents must be **actionable**: start with "execute these workstreams", include status tracking table, include completion checklists
- Plan documents must **resolve open questions**: if a prerequisite is unknown, investigate it before writing the plan. Unresolved questions create decision forks with no signposts.
- Notion MCP DI: client created internally in `wiring.ts`, not injected. Curriculum MCP pattern uses `ToolHandlerOverrides` for DI.
- Streamable-http test configs: `vitest.config.ts` (unit/integration), `vitest.e2e.config.ts` (E2E, excludes built-server), `vitest.e2e.built.config.ts` (built-server only)
- Compliant `process.env` pattern: `const testEnv: NodeJS.ProcessEnv = { ... }; loadRuntimeConfig(testEnv)` — never mutate global `process.env`

## Session: 2026-02-12 — ADR-108 and Documentation Cohesion

### Context

- Continued from workspace decomposition analysis session
- Task: transfer all architectural reasoning from cursor
  plan into permanent repo documentation
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### What Was Done

- **Created ADR-108** (`docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/108-sdk-workspace-decomposition.md`):
  The authoritative architectural decision for the 4-workspace
  decomposition. Contains full context, decision, workspace
  definitions, dependency graph, plugin architecture,
  why-not-more/fewer analysis, phased execution, Castr
  relationship, consequences, and references.
- **Updated ADR README index**: Added ADR-108 to both the
  main index and the "Key Architectural Decisions" section.
- **Rewrote `sdk-workspace-separation-plan.md`**: Now
  describes the 2-way split as Step 1 of the 4-workspace
  decomposition. References ADR-108. Updated prerequisites,
  removed stale references, added relationship to Step 2.
- **Updated 5 pipeline-enhancements plans**: Added "Workspace
  Architecture Context" sections to
  `openapi-to-tooling-integration-plan.md` (WS1),
  `openapi-to-mcp-framework-extraction-plan.md` (WS1+WS3),
  `mcp_ecosystem_integration_requirements.md` (WS1 API),
  `schema-generator-client-requirements.md` (WS1 API),
  `PHASE-4-ARTEFACT-EXPANSION.md` (WS1).
- **Updated 2 SDK/MCP enhancement plans**: Added workspace
  context to `03-mcp-infrastructure-advanced-tools-plan.md`
  (WS2 type-gen, WS4 runtime) and
  `18-schema-driven-sdk-adapter-generation-plan.md`
  (WS1 generator, WS4 consumer). Fixed stale priorities.
- **Updated `sdk-and-mcp-enhancements/README.md`**: Added
  workspace architecture section cross-referencing ADR-108.
- **Updated `high-level-plan.md`**: Expanded Item #2 from
  2-way split to 4-workspace decomposition with phased
  execution. Updated backlog (Generic Pipeline Extraction,
  Generic Runtime Extraction). Updated milestones and notes.
- **Updated navigation docs**: `plans/README.md` and
  `external/castr/README.md` now reference ADR-108.
- **Deleted cursor plan**: `sdk_workspace_decomposition_6cbebba0.plan.md`
  removed without information loss.

### Consistency Verification

- 14 markdown files reference ADR-108
- All cross-references validated
- `pnpm markdownlint:root` passes clean

### What Worked

- Creating ADR-108 first as the canonical reference made
  all subsequent updates straightforward
- Adding "Workspace Architecture Context" sections at the
  top of plans provides clear orientation without requiring
  full rewrites

### Mistakes

- **Plans skipped validation**: All planning docs went
  straight from "SDK extraction complete" to "MCP
  integration." User correctly pointed out that a
  completely rewritten SDK must be validated against real
  ES before wiring into any consumer. Added Phase 2e
  (SDK Validation) to roadmap and updated all docs.
  Lesson: after any major rewrite/re-architecture,
  validation against the real system is a non-negotiable
  step — never skip straight to the next consumer.

---

## Session: 2026-02-11 — High-Level Plan Rewrite

### Context

- User flagged that `high-level-plan.md` was badly out of date — many items no longer exist or are irrelevant
- User provided explicit priority sequence: MCP search integration → compare/replace REST search → SDK workspace separation → Castr integration
- Performed full audit of ~200 plan files across all `.agent/plans/` directories
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### What Was Done

- **Full rewrite of `high-level-plan.md`**: Restructured from 10 numbered items (many stale) to 8 prioritised items matching actual priorities. Removed dead references, added Castr integration as explicit priority #3, added completed work section, added deferred/won't-implement section
- **Updated `wire-hybrid-search.md`**: Added compare-and-replace as in-scope (was previously listed as out of scope). Added Phase 5 execution phase. Added second target state diagram showing post-replacement architecture. Updated success criteria.
- **Updated `roadmap.md`**: Added compare-and-replace tasks to Phase 3 task list
- **Updated `semantic-search.prompt.md`**: Added compare-and-replace bullets to MCP integration section

### Key Findings from Plan Audit

- ~200 plan files exist; ~90 in archive/completed directories
- Many items in old high-level plan referenced completed or superseded work
- Castr requirements are well-documented in `external/castr/` but weren't in the high-level plan
- SDK workspace separation plan exists in `pipeline-enhancements/` and is prerequisite for Castr
- The "compare and replace REST search" step was missing from all plans despite being a clear user priority

### Patterns to Remember

- Always audit archived plans when rewriting strategic docs — the archive structure tells you what's done
- User priorities may not match plan document structure — listen to the user, not the docs
- "Out of scope" items in plans should be reviewed when priorities change

---

## Session: 2026-02-11 — Checkpoint E2: Result Pattern + TSDoc + Directive Review

### Context

- Checkpoint E2 complete: all SDK service I/O returns `Result<T, E>`, comprehensive TSDoc across SDK and CLI
- Full quality gate chain passes: clean, type-gen, build, type-check, format:root, markdownlint:root, lint:fix, test, test:ui, test:e2e, test:e2e:built, smoke:dev:stub
- Directive review completed with sub-agent audits
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### What Was Built

- **Error types**: `AdminError` (replaced `IndexMetaError`), `ObservabilityError` discriminated unions; `RetrievalError` already existed
- **Result wrapping**: All 16 SDK service I/O methods return `Result<T, E>` via `ok()`/`err()`
- **Silent error swallowing fixed**: `observability.persistEvent`, `observability.fetchTelemetry`, `admin.safeDeleteIndex` no longer silently swallow errors
- **Simplified data types**: `ConnectionStatus` (removed `connected`/`error`), `SynonymsResult` (removed `success`/`error`) — redundant with `Result`
- **CLI error boundary**: All command `.action()` blocks check `result.ok`, print `type: message` on error, set `process.exitCode = 1`
- **Benchmark runners**: Updated `SearchFunction`/`UnitSearchFunction`/`SequenceSearchFunction` to return `Result`, fail fast on `!result.ok`
- **TSDoc**: Comprehensive annotations on all SDK and CLI functions, interfaces, types, constants
- **File extractions by responsibility**:
  - `admin-index-operations.ts` from `create-admin-service.ts` (index lifecycle)
  - `retrieval-search-helpers.ts` from `create-retrieval-service.ts` (sequence/unit helpers)
  - `admin-sdk-commands.ts` from `admin/index.ts` (SDK-mapped commands)
  - `admin-orchestration-commands.ts` from `admin/index.ts` (pass-through commands)
- **DRY refactor**: `benchmark-adapters.ts` — eliminated 4 identical grouping functions with generic `groupEntries<T>`, removed eslint max-lines override
- **Pure function extraction**: `calculateBenchmarkMetrics` from `runQuery` to stay under max-lines-per-function while preserving full documentation

### Mistakes Made (and Corrected)

- **CRITICAL: Compressed TSDoc to meet max-lines instead of splitting files** — the rules say "split into smaller files by responsibility", NEVER make files shorter by stripping documentation. Fixed by proper file splits.
- **Ran only `pnpm test` instead of full quality gate chain** — `pnpm test` is only unit+integration tests. The full chain includes test:ui, test:e2e, test:e2e:built, smoke:dev:stub. Must always run the full chain as specified in AGENT.md.
- TSDoc subagent added `@remarks` tags that are unsupported by the tsdoc plugin
- `{@link ./module-path}` syntax triggers `tsdoc-reference-missing-hash` — replaced with backtick module references
- `>` in TSDoc examples must use backslash escape
- `{ value: number }` in TSDoc triggers malformed inline tag — braces look like TSDoc inline tags
- `benchmark-test-harness.ts` needed explicit `LessonsSearchResult` intermediate variable to avoid type incompatibility with `ok()` wrapper

### Directive Review Findings

**SDK (23 files): ALL PASS** — No type shortcuts, no disabled checks, complete TSDoc, no unused code, fail-fast compliance, proper test patterns.

**CLI (25 files): 23 PASS, 2 pre-existing issues in files I touched:**
1. `benchmark-adapters.ts` — Had `/* eslint max-lines: [error, 275] */` override (rule workaround). **FIXED** by DRYing with generic `groupEntries<T>`, file went from 267 to 157 lines.
2. `benchmark-entry-runner.ts` — Catch blocks log errors and create synthetic 0-score results instead of failing fast. **PRE-EXISTING design choice** for benchmark resilience. Errors ARE logged and visible in results, but process exits 0 even when queries fail. Noted for future work.

### Patterns to Remember

- **NEVER compress docs to meet line limits** — always split files by responsibility
- **Full quality gate chain** from AGENT.md: clean, type-gen, build, type-check, format:root, markdownlint:root, lint:fix, test, test:ui, test:e2e, test:e2e:built, smoke:dev:stub
- `{@link ./path}` is NOT valid TSDoc — use backtick references for module paths
- DRY repetitive adapter code with generic functions + callbacks before splitting into separate files
- `toServiceError` helper pattern: catch unknown, check for `statusCode` (ES errors), always provide `type` + `message`
- `safeDeleteIndex` returning `ok(undefined)` for not-found is correct
- `handleStatus` must unwrap TWO Result calls and combine
- Benchmark runners should `throw` on `!result.ok` — fail fast, no Result propagation
- When a pre-existing eslint override exists in a file you touch, fix the root cause (DRY/split) rather than leaving the override

---

## Session: 2026-02-11 — TSDoc Compliance Fix

### Context

- Implemented full TSDoc compliance plan: fix all non-standard tags at source, delete sanitize-docs.ts
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment
- Commit: 506a9cf (pushed)

### What Was Done

- Extended `postProcessTypesSource` in `typegen-core.ts` to strip `@description`, `@constant` (both inline and multi-line), `@enum` from openapiTS output
- Deleted `sanitize-docs.ts` and entire `docs/_typedoc_src/` directory
- Moved `schema-bridge.ts` from `docs/_typedoc_src/types/` to `src/types/` as real source
- Updated all three TypeDoc configs (`typedoc.json`, `typedoc.ai.json`, `typedoc.mcp.json`) to point at `src/` directly
- Removed `docs:prepare` script and simplified all docs commands in package.json
- Removed `@module` from 84+ files across search-cli and curriculum-sdk
- Removed `@fileoverview` from 30+ files across notion-mcp, streamable-http
- Fixed one-off tags: `@property`->list, `@todo`->`@remarks TODO:`, `@default`->`@defaultValue`, `@future`->`@remarks`, `@yields`->`@returns`, `@remark`->`@remarks`, `@test`->plain comment, `@oaknational/*`/`@clerk/*`->backtick-wrapped
- Installed `eslint-plugin-tsdoc` in `@oaknational/eslint-plugin-standards`, added `tsdoc/syntax: warn`
- Created `tsdoc.json` at root and in workspaces with `@generated` files (search-cli, curriculum-sdk)
- All quality gates pass: 0 errors, 462 files changed

### Mistakes Made (and Corrected)

- Initial `@constant` regex only matched multi-line `* @constant` but missed inline `/** @constant */` — added second pattern
- Root `tsdoc.json` not picked up by workspaces because `@microsoft/tsdoc-config` stops at nearest `package.json` — had to create per-workspace `tsdoc.json` files
- `extends` in `tsdoc.json` didn't propagate tags due to version incompatibility between `@microsoft/tsdoc` and `@microsoft/tsdoc-config` — put full tag definition in each workspace's config instead
- `eslint-plugin-tsdoc` was being bundled by tsup which broke config discovery — added to `external` list in tsup.config.ts

### Patterns to Remember

- `openapiTS` emits `/** @constant */` as single-line comments AND `* @constant` as multi-line — regex must handle both
- `@microsoft/tsdoc-config` `loadForFolder()` stops walking up at nearest `package.json` — each workspace needs its own `tsdoc.json`
- ESLint plugins that use dynamic file resolution (`@microsoft/tsdoc-config`) must be marked `external` in tsup bundles
- `perl -i -pe` for single-line replacements, `perl -i -0pe` for multi-line patterns spanning newlines
- The `docs/_typedoc_src` layer was unnecessary — TypeDoc can read `src/` directly with `--skipErrorChecking`

---

## Session: 2026-02-11 — Directive Review + E2 Planning

### Context

- Reviewed all work against `.agent/directives/` — found two non-compliances
- Planned Checkpoint E2 (Result pattern + TSDoc) and inserted it between E and F
- Partially started: `RetrievalError` type added to `types/retrieval-results.ts` (type only)
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### Key Findings from Directive Review

- **Result pattern**: Retrieval, admin (non-meta), and observe services throw instead of `Result<T, E>`. The rules say "Don't throw, use Result." This affects ~25 files across SDK, CLI, and benchmarks.
- **TSDoc depth**: Private helpers (`registerLessonsCmd`, etc.) have minimal one-line JSDoc. Rules require "exhaustive, comprehensive TSDoc annotations" on ALL functions.
- **Everything else compliant**: Cardinal Rule (types from schema), no type shortcuts, DI for testability, fail fast, clear boundaries, consistent naming, architectural model — all pass.

### Design Decisions for E2

- **Per-service error types**: `RetrievalError`, `AdminError` (replaces `IndexMetaError`), `ObservabilityError`
- **Sync observe methods stay as-is**: `getRecentZeroHits`, `getZeroHitSummary` are pure in-memory, cannot fail
- **TSDoc standard**: summary + `@param` + `@returns` on everything; `@example` on public APIs

### Partial Changes in Working Tree

- `types/retrieval-results.ts` has `RetrievalError` type definition added (not yet integrated)
- `.prettierignore` fixed (old workspace path → `oak-search-cli`)
- SDK `README.md` created at `packages/sdks/oak-search-sdk/README.md`

### Patterns to Remember

- When a directive review reveals significant work, update the plan BEFORE coding
- Per-service error types are cleaner than a unified `SearchSdkError` — each service has different failure modes
- `@oaknational/result` has `ok()`, `err()`, `isOk()`, `isErr()`, `unwrap()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`, `mapErr()`, `unwrapOr()`, `unwrapOrElse()` — rich utility set

---

## Session: 2026-02-11 — Documentation Consolidation

### Context

- Post-Checkpoint E documentation sweep
- Updated all plans, prompts, and roadmap to reflect current reality
- Fixed stale workspace name references
- Created SDK README from ephemeral plan content

### What Was Done

- Updated `semantic-search.prompt.md`: now reflects Checkpoint E complete, F is next priority
- Updated `search-sdk-cli.plan.md`: fixed tautological "renamed from" references, updated status header and context table
- Updated `roadmap.md`: marked Phase 2 complete, unblocked Phase 3 (MCP integration), fixed execution order diagram
- Fixed `ARCHITECTURE.md`: replaced "being retired" note with factual "was retired" statement
- Fixed `README.md`: updated System Topology diagram to reference SDK
- Fixed `.prettierignore`: updated stale `oak-open-curriculum-semantic-search` path to `oak-search-cli`
- Created `packages/sdks/oak-search-sdk/README.md`: permanent documentation for the SDK (usage, architecture, consumers)
- `.cursorignore` has a stale reference but is system-managed (cannot be edited by agent)

### Patterns to Remember

- Session prompts in `.agent/prompts/` should be updated at the end of each session, not just napkin
- Plan documents should use the old name in "renamed from" clauses, not the current name (tautology)

---

## Session: 2026-02-11 — Checkpoint E: CLI Rename + Wiring

### Context

- Checkpoint E complete: workspace renamed, CLI wired to SDK, evaluation rewired
- 934 tests GREEN (82 test files), all quality gates pass
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment

### What Was Built

- `src/cli/shared/` — `createCliSdk`, validators (type guards), pass-through helper, output formatting
- `src/cli/search/` — lessons/units/sequences/suggest/facets via RetrievalService
- `src/cli/admin/` — setup/reset/status/synonyms/meta via AdminService + pass-through orchestration
- `src/cli/observe/` — telemetry/summary via ObservabilityService + purge pass-through
- `src/cli/eval/` — benchmark/validate/typegen pass-throughs
- Evaluation rewired: benchmark runners use `sdk.retrieval.searchLessons` etc.
- All legacy `package.json` scripts migrated to CLI entry points

### What Works

- Shared `registerPassThrough` eliminates process.env lint errors (omitting env uses Node.js default)
- Shared `validators.ts` with `isSubject`/`isKeyStage`/`isSearchScope` type guards eliminates all `as` assertions
- Breaking command registration into small functions (`registerLessonsCmd` etc.) keeps under 50-line limit
- `isIndexMetaDoc` from SDK validates JSON.parse output without unsafe assignment
- `registerBashPassThrough` handles shell scripts (alias-swap.sh)

### Mistakes Made (and Corrected)

- Forgot the units benchmark runner also had `as SearchSubjectSlug` — caught by second lint pass
- Added subject mapping lines to `runUnitQuery` which pushed it over 50-line function limit — extracted `toSearchSubject` and `extractUnitSlugs` helpers
- `JSON.parse()` returns `any` — fixed with `const parsed: unknown = JSON.parse(json)` + `isIndexMetaDoc` guard
- Pass-through commands initially used `env: process.env` explicitly — removed since it's the default

### Patterns to Remember

- `const parsed: unknown = JSON.parse(json)` is the correct pattern for avoiding `no-unsafe-assignment`
- Use `isSubject()` then fallback to `'science'` for `AllSubjectSlug → SearchSubjectSlug` mapping (KS4 variants)
- Omit `env` from `execFileSync` options — Node.js inherits `process.env` by default
- `max-lines-per-function` (50 lines) — extract per-command registration functions
- Commander `this.args` in `function action(this: Command)` avoids unused parameter lint errors

---

## Session: 2026-02-10 — SDK Full Extraction (Checkpoints B+C+D)

### Context

- Checkpoints A–D complete: SDK workspace with all three services implemented
- 34 tests GREEN (25 integration + 9 unit), all quality gates pass
- Branch: feat/semantic_search_deployment (ahead of origin)
- Next: Checkpoint E (CLI rename + subcommand wiring)

### What Was Built

- `src/internal/` — ES search adapter (`EsSearchFn`), index resolver, internal types
- `src/retrieval/` — 4-way RRF query builders, query processing, suggestions, facets, score normalisation
- `src/admin/` — Setup, connection, listing, synonyms, index-meta (Result pattern), bulk ingest
- `src/observability/` — Instance-level FIFO store, ES persistence, telemetry queries
- `src/create-search-sdk.ts` — Real factory replacing the stub
- Test helpers — `vi.spyOn` on Client methods, structurally valid empty responses

### What Works

- The DI pattern is clean — extraction worked as a file-move + adaptation exercise
- Types flowing from Curriculum SDK prevented shape mismatches
- `vi.spyOn` on the injected Client is the right mocking strategy — no type assertions needed
- Splitting files to stay under 250-line max-lines rule works well for modularity
- ES client v9 uses `document` not `body` for `client.index()` calls
- Synonym sets need `[...synonymSet.synonyms_set]` to convert readonly to mutable

### Mistakes Made (and Corrected)

- Initially created `ZeroHitEvent` with `query` field — the schema uses `text`
- Used `body` parameter for `client.index()` — ES v9 uses `document`
- Type assertions (`as`) crept in during initial porting — all replaced with type guards
- Files exceeded 250-line limit — had to split into `index-meta.ts`, `ingest.ts`, `es-error-guards.ts`, `zero-hit-telemetry.ts`
- `buildSearchParams` complexity exceeded 8 — split into `assignQueryOrRetriever` + `assignOptionalFields`
- `toMappingParams` returned `unknown` for settings/mappings — needed `estypes.IndicesIndexSettings` + `estypes.MappingTypeMapping`
- Suggestion items need `url` and `contexts` fields, not just `label` and `scope`
- `Record<string, unknown>` is banned — used `isHighlightRecord` type guard instead
- `Object.keys()` is restricted — used `for...in` with `hasOwnProperty` guard

### Patterns to Remember

- ES client v9: `document` not `body` for indexing
- ES client v9: spread readonly arrays before passing to mutable params
- `isPlainObject` type guard satisfies both `IndicesIndexSettings` and `MappingTypeMapping`
- `isKnownSubject` type guard replaces `subject as keyof typeof SUBJECT_TO_PARENT`
- `extractStatusCode` centralises ES error code extraction without assertions
- `for...in` + `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` for iterating unknown objects

### Notion MCP Workspace Removal — Documentation Cleanup

Completed systematic removal of actionable `oak-notion-mcp` references from:
- **5 active plans** with work items targeting the workspace:
  `config-architecture-standardisation-plan`, `stryker-integration-plan`,
  `global-state-elimination-and-testing-discipline-plan`,
  `node-sdk-config-and-di-remediation-plan`, `08-summary-and-coordination`
- **5 additional active plans** with incidental references:
  `matchmedia-di-refactoring-plan`, `sdk-publishing-and-versioning-plan`,
  `eslint-enhancement-plan`, `test-isolation-architecture-fix`,
  `quality-fix-plan-template`
- **4 ADRs**: ADR-004 deprecated; ADR-005, 006, 018 examples updated
- **1 architecture doc**: `openapi-pipeline.md` generalised
- Archive files left untouched (historical records)
