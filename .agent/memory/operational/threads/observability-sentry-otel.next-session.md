# Next-Session Record — `observability-sentry-otel` thread

**Last refreshed**: 2026-04-24 (Pippin / cursor / claude-opus-4-7)
after a focused post-WS0 plan-body refinement session that recorded the
agreed WS3 cancellation-script rewrite directly into
[`sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md).
Plan-body refinement is **uncommitted** — the modification is in the
working tree only; the next session commits it (either standalone or
folded into the WS1 RED commit, agent's call).

WS0 (decide → document) remains **landed** at `06bf25d7`. The thread
still picks up at WS1 (RED contract tests). The WS3 scope in the plan
has shifted from "verify existing script" to **"rewrite to the simpler
rule using the canonical `semver` package"** after a careful re-read
of `vercel-ignore-production-non-release-build.mjs` post-WS0 surfaced
three substantive defects: missing `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF === 'main'`
branch gate; hand-rolled major.minor.patch parser instead of canonical
`semver`; fail-open clause conflating transient git-resolution failure
with deterministic repo defects. WS3 now lands a ~50-line rewrite plus
unit-test rewrite plus a second ADR-163 §10 amendment.

WS2 also picked up a small validator denylist correction:
`isValidReleaseName` permits `/` (Sentry forbids) and rejects the
literal `latest` (Sentry permits) — both diverge from Sentry's
documented rules and ride alongside the resolver rewrite because both
resolvers consume that predicate for branch-URL host validation.

Owner-direction rules captured in the plan body's §Owner Direction
block (settled, not re-opened):

1. **Release identifier scheme**: production = root `package.json`
   semver at build time; preview = `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` host (e.g.
   `poc-oak-open-curriculum-mcp-git-feat-otelsentryenhancements`).
   Build-time AND runtime resolvers must produce the SAME string per
   environment — single source of truth, no divergence.
2. **Production build cancellation**: builds on `main` cancelled
   unless the commit advances the root `package.json` semver beyond
   the previously-deployed version. Merge commits don't trigger
   production builds; only semantic-release commits do.

Discovery during the post-WS0 design discussion: the cancellation
script at
`packages/core/build-metadata/build-scripts/vercel-ignore-production-non-release-build.mjs`
(~205 lines, six unit-test branches) is over-built and missing the
branch-gate that ADR §1's truth table requires. The wiring (via
`apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/vercel.json`'s `ignoreCommand`)
is correct and stays unchanged. WS3 in the plan is now a **rewrite**
(~50 lines using the canonical `semver` npm package, branch gate
added, asymmetric current-vs-previous handling) + unit-test rewrite +
ADR-163 §10 re-amendment. Wiring integration check (originally WS3
work) folds into WS1.4 as planned.

The release-identifier work IS new code: WS1/WS2 rewrite
`resolvePreviewRelease` (build-time) and extend `resolveSentryRelease`
(runtime) to consume `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` host; deletes the obsolete
`preview-<slug>-<sha>` shape and the `slugifyBranch` helper; lands a
cross-resolver contract test as the structural anti-drift gate.

The relevant plan surfaces are now:

- [`sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md)
  — **next-session pickup**; the release-identifier alignment plan.
- [`mcp-canonical-deploy-shape-and-warnings-doctrine.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/archive/completed/mcp-canonical-deploy-shape-and-warnings-doctrine.plan.md)
  — archived closure record for the completed repo-owned corrective
  lane.
- [`sentry-observability-maximisation-mcp.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/active/sentry-observability-maximisation-mcp.plan.md)
  — parent context; the L-8 lane that landed the diverging
  build-time resolver this plan corrects.
- [`mcp-http-runtime-canonicalisation.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/future/mcp-http-runtime-canonicalisation.plan.md)
  — separate future home for broader runtime simplification once
  owner-run validation is complete.
- [`synthetic-monitoring.plan.owner-externalised-2026-04-23.md`](../../../plans/observability/archive/superseded/synthetic-monitoring.plan.owner-externalised-2026-04-23.md)
  — closed note confirming monitor creation/operation are owner-external.

Underlying branch evidence still in force:
L-8 Correction WI 1-5 remain landed in `fb047f86`; the dedicated
`dist/server.js` deploy boundary is the verified deploy shape; the
shared Step 4 foundation work and the former
`oak-search-sdk` / `sdk-codegen` / `search-cli` backlog are retired as
authoritative history after the green repo-root rerun and the later
strict corrective pass.

**Consumed at**: WS0 ADR-163 amendment lands.
**Lifecycle**: rewrite as the plan moves through workstreams; delete
when the plan completes (WS7 doc propagation done, both rules proven
via Sentry MCP `find_releases` + the cancellation rule's existing
unit-test evidence + a captured cancellation event or controlled
rehearsal).

## Thread identity

- **Thread**: `observability-sentry-otel`
- **Thread purpose**: product-grade Sentry / OTel observability for
  the MCP HTTP server on Vercel, including release attribution,
  deploy proof, and request-context diagnostics.
- **Branch**: `feat/otel_sentry_enhancements` (branch-primary)

## Landing Target (per PDR-026)

**This session (post-WS0 plan-body refinement)**: refined the plan
body to encode the agreed WS3 cancellation-script rewrite (~50 lines,
canonical `semver` package, branch gate, asymmetric current/previous
handling) + folded the validator denylist correction into WS2.
**Landing**: working-tree modification of
`.agent/plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`,
**not committed** this session.

What prevented committing: explicit owner direction to handoff before
committing ("let's continue in a new session, for now please run
/jc-session-handoff"). Named owner-direction trade-off; evidence is
the user's session-handoff invocation message; falsifiability — the
prior assistant turn ended with "Ready when you want to commit it"
and the next user message asked for handoff, not commit.

Next session re-attempts: open the plan file, re-read the WS3
section, and either (a) commit the plan refinement standalone with a
`docs(plan)` message or (b) fold it into the WS1 RED commit so plan
authority and tests land together. Either ordering is honest; agent
chooses based on context at session start.

**Prior session (WS0 amendment landing — preserved for audit)**: WS0
of
[`sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md)
in commit `06bf25d7`:

- ADR-163 §1 rewritten with the per-environment release-identifier
  truth table (production = root `package.json` semver;
  preview/non-main-production = `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` host's leftmost
  label; development = `dev-<shortSha>`; `SENTRY_RELEASE_OVERRIDE`
  always wins; both build-time and runtime resolvers must produce the
  SAME string per environment).
- ADR-163 §10 added: production-build cancellation rule formalised,
  including its truth table, the canonical script path
  (`packages/core/build-metadata/build-scripts/vercel-ignore-production-non-release-build.mjs`),
  the workspace shim, the `vercel.json` `ignoreCommand` wiring, and
  the fail-open trade-off when previous-version resolution fails.
- §3 and §5 cross-linked to §1's per-environment grain so the "one
  release → many deploys" model now operates per-environment, not
  across the preview→production boundary.
- Process-gap finding: cross-resolver contract test named as the
  structural anti-drift gate (not procedural review discipline),
  with the new `libs ← core` devDependency edge documented.
- Four new Alternatives Considered entries (#11–#14) and two new
  Enforcement items (#5 cross-resolver contract; #6 cancellation
  wiring integration).
- Reviewer Dispositions block records the WS0.2 reviewer pass:
  `assumptions-reviewer`, `sentry-reviewer`,
  `architecture-reviewer-fred` — all BLOCKING + IMPORTANT findings
  ACCEPTED and applied (notably: qualifying `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` as
  an Oak operational assumption rather than a Vercel guarantee;
  noting Oak's `SENTRY_RELEASE_NAME_PATTERN` diverges from Sentry's
  documented rules; reframing the impact as "split-release
  pollution" of Sentry release-health metrics).

Evidence:

- ADR amendment + plan file landed in `06bf25d7` (single commit, all
  pre-commit gates passed including dep-cruise + 74-task turbo cache);
- `feat/otel_sentry_enhancements` branch advanced;
- WS1 is the next workstream and lands as a separate commit per the
  user's turn-boundary instruction.

## Lane State

### Owning plan(s)

- **Next-session pickup**:
  [`sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md)
  — release-identifier alignment + ADR-163 amendment + cancellation
  ADR linkage.
- **Repo-owned corrective lane closure record**:
  [`mcp-canonical-deploy-shape-and-warnings-doctrine.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/archive/completed/mcp-canonical-deploy-shape-and-warnings-doctrine.plan.md)
- **Parent context**:
  [`sentry-observability-maximisation-mcp.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/active/sentry-observability-maximisation-mcp.plan.md)
- **Separate future work**:
  [`mcp-http-runtime-canonicalisation.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/future/mcp-http-runtime-canonicalisation.plan.md)
- **Closed repo monitoring lane**:
  [`synthetic-monitoring.plan.owner-externalised-2026-04-23.md`](../../../plans/observability/archive/superseded/synthetic-monitoring.plan.owner-externalised-2026-04-23.md)

### Current objective

Land the release-identifier single-source-of-truth plan WS by WS.
WS0 is **landed** (`06bf25d7`). Next: WS1 RED contract tests
(cross-resolver contract + branch-URL precedence + cancellation
wiring integration check), then WS2 GREEN resolver rewrite.

### Current state

- WS0 landed: ADR-163 amendment + plan file in `06bf25d7`; continuity
  refresh in `7b4de7a4`.
- Plan body refined this session to encode the WS3 cancellation-script
  rewrite + WS2 validator denylist correction; the modification is in
  the working tree at
  `.agent/plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`
  but **not committed**. Next session commits it.
- Cancellation script at
  `packages/core/build-metadata/build-scripts/vercel-ignore-production-non-release-build.mjs`
  is over-built (~205 lines, hand-rolled semver parser/comparator,
  missing the `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF === 'main'` branch gate that ADR
  §1's truth table requires). WS3 in the plan is now a **rewrite**
  (~50 lines using the canonical `semver` npm package) + unit-test
  rewrite + ADR-163 §10 re-amendment to match the simpler shape.
  Wiring (via `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/vercel.json`'s
  `ignoreCommand`) is correct and stays unchanged; the wiring
  integration check folds into WS1.4.
- `semver` is NOT yet a workspace dependency; WS3.1 adds it to
  `packages/core/build-metadata/package.json`.
- Build-time `resolvePreviewRelease` still emits
  `preview-<slug>-<sha>` (the divergent shape); runtime
  `resolveSentryRelease` still emits semver everywhere. WS1 RED
  tests pin the new contract, WS2 GREEN rewrites both resolvers to
  consume `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` host's leftmost label, AND corrects
  `isValidReleaseName` to mirror Sentry's documented denylist (accept
  `latest`, reject `/`).
- `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` is already in the env schema
  (`apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/src/env.ts`) and used in
  `runtime-config.ts` for hostname allowlisting; no schema change
  needed for the resolver work.
- The bounded repo-owned corrective lane remains complete and
  archived; `fb047f86` still supplies L-8 Correction WI 1-5; the
  `dist/server.js` deploy boundary is the verified deploy shape.
- No active repo-owned blocker beyond the plan's WS sequence.

### Blockers / low-confidence areas

- WS1 sets up the cross-resolver contract test as a new file; needs
  to live where both `packages/core/build-metadata` and
  `packages/libs/sentry-node` are accessible. ADR §1 + §10 names the
  edge as `libs ← core` devDependency; WS1 establishes that edge if
  not already present.
- WS1 cancellation-wiring integration check must read
  `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/vercel.json` and assert
  the `ignoreCommand` resolves to the canonical script via the
  workspace shim — i.e. catches accidental shim deletion or path
  drift, not script logic (already covered by unit tests).
- End-to-end Sentry verification (WS6) requires a fresh preview
  deploy after WS2 lands. Push a no-op commit on
  `feat/otel_sentry_enhancements` if needed to trigger the deploy.

### Standing decisions

- This was **one bounded repo-owned follow-through lane**, not an
  ongoing stream of repo monitoring work.
- There is **no repo-owned monitor setup lane**. Repo scope stops at a
  clean handoff into owner-handled validation; monitor setup remains
  outside the repo.
- There are **no follow-up placeholders**. Future work either has a
  real home or is deleted.
- Canonicalisation remains valuable, but it is explicitly separate
  from the deploy-boundary repair.
- The local runner stack stays unless the verified deploy contract
  proves a smaller change is required.
- No child-process proof in tests. Production-only branches are covered
  by DI-friendly code tests plus a realistic production-build gate
  under representative env.
- A green repo-root rerun retires the old consumer backlog, but it does
  not replace a correctness review against the repository rules.
- No fallbacks, no wrappers, no JS-specific override paths, no
  compatibility layers.
- One fixed ESM-only export-surface contract across internal
  workspaces; no CJS support and no per-workspace improvisation.
- No further repo coding session is queued on this lane unless
  owner-run validation surfaces a fresh repo defect.

### Next safe step

Open the plan file first; the WS3 rewrite design from this session is
in the working tree but uncommitted. Commit choice (agent's call at
session start):

- **Option A** (cleaner history): commit the plan refinement
  standalone with a `docs(plan)` message, then proceed to WS1 RED
  in a separate commit.
- **Option B** (lockstep): fold the plan refinement into the WS1 RED
  commit so the plan-body authority and the failing tests it
  authorises land together.

Either ordering satisfies turn-boundary discipline; Option A is
slightly more orthodox (plan-as-decision lands before plan-as-test).

Then proceed to WS1 of
[`sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/current/sentry-release-identifier-single-source-of-truth.plan.md)
— RED contract tests, separate commit/turn boundary from WS0:

1. Add the cross-resolver contract test asserting that
   `resolveBuildTimeRelease` (build-time, `packages/core/build-metadata`)
   and `resolveSentryRelease` (runtime, `packages/libs/sentry-node`)
   produce the SAME string for the same env inputs across the §1
   truth-table rows. Establish the `libs ← core` devDependency edge
   if it doesn't already exist (per ADR §1's process-gap finding).
2. Add the branch-URL-precedence test pinning that both resolvers
   extract the leftmost host label of `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` for
   preview/non-main-production (with `SENTRY_RELEASE_OVERRIDE`
   precedence preserved).
3. Add the cancellation-wiring integration test asserting that
   `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/vercel.json`'s
   `ignoreCommand` resolves through the workspace shim to the
   canonical script — catches shim deletion or path drift; does not
   re-test script logic (already covered).
4. Tests are RED in WS1 (build-time still emits old shape); WS2
   makes them GREEN by rewriting `resolvePreviewRelease` and
   extending `resolveSentryRelease`.

If owner-run validation of the previously-archived corrective lane
surfaces a fresh repo defect in parallel, that takes priority — open
the smallest targeted repair lane that names that defect explicitly,
park the release-identifier plan briefly.

### Active track links

- None. `.agent/memory/operational/tracks/` contains only
  `.gitkeep` and `README.md`.

### Promotion watchlist

- PDR-015 candidate for an assumption-challenge gate on
  architectural-review outputs if the pattern recurs.
- ADR-163 amendment candidate widened this session: its gate-mapping
  table now also needs to cover the realistic production-build gate for
  env-gated Sentry esbuild-plugin paths once child-process proof is
  rejected by testing doctrine.
- Future promotion of
  [`mcp-http-runtime-canonicalisation.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/future/mcp-http-runtime-canonicalisation.plan.md)
  only after owner-run validation is complete and there is real
  appetite for runtime simplification.

---

## Earlier Landed Substance Still In Force

- **Warnings are not deferrable**. Build warnings from vendor tooling
  are treated as blocking failures, not "verify later" notes.
- **The root cause of the failing preview is known**:
  `dist/index.js` was the deployed artefact, and its export shape did
  not honour Vercel's Express adapter contract.
- **Preview proof is gated on Step 4 honesty**. A green build or an app-
  local green test run is not sufficient while the repo still has
  hidden strictness/test-doctrine gaps.
- **L-8 is still the parent engineering lane** in
  [`sentry-observability-maximisation-mcp.plan.md`](../../../plans/observability/active/sentry-observability-maximisation-mcp.plan.md);
  the archived corrective-lane closure record now captures the repo
  work that previously sat between L-8 and owner-run validation.

The abandoned canonical-layout attempt still matters only as input to
the separate canonicalisation brief. It is no longer the binding shape
for this branch.

---

## Guardrails

Do **not**:

- pre-empt the contract with a guessed export shape;
- reopen broader canonicalisation work;
- recreate a repo monitoring lane;
- invent a new repo-owned repair cycle without a fresh defect from
  owner-run validation;
- treat monitor setup as in-repo acceptance work.
