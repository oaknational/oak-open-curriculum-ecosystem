# Standardising Architecture – Part 2 Implementation Plan (Core, Providers, Explicit Injection)

Strategic context: This document is the detailed execution plan for Part 2 and complements the roadmap in `.agent/plans/standardising-architecture-high-level-plan.md`. It assumes Part 1 (mechanical normalisation) has landed per `.agent/plans/standardising-architecture-part1.md`.

This file intentionally contains no code snippets that belong in scripts; it focuses on intent, invariants, phases, acceptance, and verifiable outcomes.

British spelling applies throughout (behaviour, normalisation, rationalisation, etc.).

Status: IN PROGRESS. Working branch: `feat/standardising_architecture_part_2`.

Completed so far:

- Mechanical deconfliction rename applied in both servers: `src/tools/tools` → `src/tools/runtime`, all imports updated.
- Quality gates PASS after rename: format, type‑check, lint, test, build.
- Baseline detection inventory captured (adaptive env in `histos-env`; direct `process.env` usage in both servers).
- ESLint boundary snapshot captured (root `eslint-rules/boundary-rules.ts` and phenotype configs).
- Core package scaffolded at `packages/core/mcp-core` exposing minimal `createRuntime` and provider contracts (no provider imports). Build PASS.
- Added configuration file `ecosystem/psycha/oak-notion-mcp/src/config/runtime.json`; server wiring now reads config for logger level/name and server identity. Detection logic removed from wiring.
- Barrel rationalisation: renamed core registry interface to `CoreToolRegistry` to avoid schema collisions; imports/exports updated and lint PASS.
- Providers: scaffolded `packages/providers/mcp-providers-node` with minimal Node clock, console logger, and in‑memory storage; unit tests added; monorepo gates PASS.
- Provider contracts: shared helper added at `@oaknational/mcp-core/testing/provider-contract`; consumed by Node providers with unit + integration tests — PASS.
- Notion server wiring refined: static logger import (no require), minimal runtime config validation via `validateRuntimeConfig`, runtime composed via core factory; all workspaces build PASS after correcting alias policy.
- Documentation: added `docs/architecture/provider-contracts.md` and `docs/architecture/greek-ecosystem-deprecation.md`; updated core/providers READMEs.

---

## 1. Intent & Impact

- Intent: Decouple runtime concerns via explicit provider injection around a shared platform‑agnostic core while enforcing strict architectural boundaries and import hygiene. Replace runtime auto‑detection with configuration.
- Impact sought:
  - Clear separation of concerns (core vs providers vs server app wiring)
  - Predictable configuration‑driven behaviour (no implicit detection)
  - Stronger purity boundaries enforced by lint rules
  - Improved testability via contract tests and provider matrix

---

## 2. Scope & Non‑Goals

In scope (Part 2):

- Introduce `@oaknational/mcp-core` package containing interfaces, pure utilities, and a factory for runtime composition.
- Implement provider modules (Node, Cloudflare) that implement the core contracts.
- Replace detection logic with configuration‑driven selection (e.g. `src/config/runtime.json`).
- Refactor server bootstrap to dependency injection (construct runtime via core factory and pass into tools/integrations).
- Enforce strict import hygiene with eslint-plugin-import-x (alias‑only cross‑boundary imports; no relative parent imports; no internal modules beyond approved public subpaths).
- Mechanical deconfliction rename: `src/tools/tools` → `src/tools/runtime` with import updates. (COMPLETED)
- Barrel rationalisation and naming clarity (e.g., export runtime registry as `CoreToolRegistry`; keep schema types local).

Non‑Goals (branch focus):

- Behaviour changes or feature work. Part 2 primarily standardises naming and boundaries to improve onboarding and maintainability. Any feature drift is unacceptable and must be blocked.

Out of scope:

- Non-essential feature work unrelated to provider/core separation.
- Broad performance optimisation (measure first; limited micro‑optimisations only if indicated by benchmarks).

Note: Coding work in Part 2 must follow TDD with Vitest (repo standard). Documentation work is explicitly exempt from TDD.

---

## 3. Invariants / Guardrails

1. Configuration (not detection) selects providers / runtime.
2. The core package must not import providers (one‑way dependency).
3. Strict import hygiene (import‑x):
   - Alias‑only across boundaries
   - `no-relative-parent-imports`
   - `no-internal-modules`, except explicitly approved public subpaths
4. No behavioural regressions across providers: provider contract tests must pass equivalently.
5. British spelling in new/updated textual artefacts.
6. Prefer smaller, atomic modules and functions with no side effects.
7. For TS/Node:
   - Use Vitest for tests
   - Use `tsx` for executing TypeScript scripts
   - Do not use `any`
   - Prefer type guards over type assertions

---

## 4. Target State

- `packages/core/mcp-core/` (publish name: `@oaknational/mcp-core`)
  - Exposes interfaces, types, and pure utilities.
  - Provides a factory: `createRuntime(providers)` returning `{ logger, storage, clock, … }`.
  - Contains no provider imports.
- Providers:
  - `providers/node` and `providers/cloudflare` modules implementing the same contracts.
  - Node provider present (clock/logger/storage) with unit tests; Cloudflare provider queued.
  - Selected exclusively via configuration file (e.g., `src/config/runtime.json`).
- Server wiring:
  - `src/app/wiring.ts` reads config, composes runtime via core factory, and prepares for injection into `src/tools/*` and `src/integrations/*`. (Factory composition complete; injection deferred to avoid behaviour drift)
- Lint boundaries:
  - Core cannot depend on providers.
  - Tools/integrations consume only injected runtime or public core interfaces.
  - Alias‑only cross‑package imports.
- Mechanical rename applied:
  - `src/tools/tools` → `src/tools/runtime` with updated imports. (COMPLETED)
- Barrel rationalisation:
  - Avoid layered collisions; clarify names (e.g., `CoreToolRegistry` for runtime registry types; schema/types kept local).

---

## 5. Quality Gates (Shared)

Run from the repository root once per gate (single invocation; wait for completion). Run at sensible intervals and before merge:

- `pnpm format`
- `pnpm type-check`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`

Part 2 adds provider contract tests and (optionally) a small e2e matrix across providers.

---

## 6. Test Strategy (TDD)

- Red‑Green‑Refactor; test behaviours only (never implementation or types).
- Core (Moria): Unit tests only for pure interfaces/utilities/factory; no dependencies; co-located `*.unit.test.ts`.
- Providers (Histoi): Unit tests for pure functions; in‑process integration tests for assembly; all IO mocked; simple fakes only; `*.unit.test.ts` / `*.integration.test.ts`.
- Psycha (Wiring): In‑process integration tests for dependency assembly; no process/network calls; simple fakes; `*.integration.test.ts`.
- E2E: Optional stdio smoke path; off by default (side effects/costs).
- No type assertions; prefer type guards and proper types in code and tests.

---

## 7. ESLint & Import Hygiene

- Adopt strict `eslint-plugin-import-x` configuration:
  - Enforce alias‑only cross‑boundary imports
  - Disallow `../` parent imports across boundaries
  - Forbid `no-internal-modules` except approved public subpaths
- Maintain phenotype boundary rules from Part 1; remove legacy duplicates only after Part 2 stabilises.

Alias policy clarification (per high-level plan):

- Reserve `@oaknational/*` exclusively for published packages; do not use it as an internal alias.
- Use internal `@workspace/*` aliases for cross-workspace imports only. Prefer relative imports for intra-package paths.
- For intra-repo TypeScript sources, omit `.js` in import specifiers. Keep `.js` suffix only for deep ESM imports from external packages when required by the runtime/bundler.

Snapshot (captured):

- Central boundaries in `eslint-rules/boundary-rules.ts` enforce `tools` ↔ `integrations` isolation.
- Phenotype configs import central rules; strict `no-relative-parent-imports` and `no-internal-modules` remain OFF pending alias adoption.

Aliases (internal workspace scope; distinct from publish scope):

- Reserve `@oaknational/*` for published packages only.
- Introduce `@workspace/*` aliases in `tsconfig.base.json`:
  - `@workspace/apps/*` → `apps/*/src/*`
  - `@workspace/core/*` → `packages/core/*/src/*`
  - `@workspace/libs/*` → `packages/libs/*/src/*`
  - `@workspace/sdks/*` → `packages/sdks/*/src/*`

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                     | Mitigation                                             | Signal                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Provider leakage into core               | Interface segregation; lint boundaries; contract tests | No core→provider imports; tests pass  |
| Behaviour divergence between providers   | Shared contract test suite                             | Equal pass set across providers       |
| Config sprawl / ambiguity                | Minimal config schema, ownership documented            | Stable minimal config footprint       |
| Performance overhead from indirection    | Benchmark before/after; optimise only if indicated     | Acceptable latency and resource usage |
| Ambiguous ownership                      | CODEOWNERS, package READMEs with roles                 | Clear ownership, fewer review loops   |
| Rename fallout (`tools/tools` → runtime) | Mechanical codemod + gates; idempotency check          | Zero or minimal diffs; gates green    |

---

## 9. Reporting & Acceptance Criteria

Report artefacts (append to Part 1 report or add a Part 2 section):

- Provider contract test summary per provider
- Lint boundary verification output (no violations)
- Config schema and example (`src/config/runtime.json`)
- Evidence of removal of detection logic
- Rename application summary (`tools/tools` → `tools/runtime`), import rewrite counts
- Barrel rationalisation notes (collisions avoided; naming clarified)
- Export surface parity report (baseline vs post) with empty diff
- Residual token scan report confirming only archived/pointer occurrences

Acceptance (Part 2):

1. Core adopted; providers injected explicitly via config; no detection logic remains.
2. Strict import‑x boundary rules active (alias‑only, no parent relatives, no internal modules beyond approved public subpaths).
3. `src/tools/tools` renamed to `src/tools/runtime` with imports updated.
4. Provider contract tests pass for all providers; e2e smoke tests pass.
5. Build, lint, type‑check, and test gates green monorepo‑wide.
6. Documentation updated (core README, provider READMEs, architecture pointers). Legacy narratives archived.
7. Export surface parity preserved (baseline vs post equal; `default` treated separately).
8. Greek ecosystem architecture fully removed from active code/comments/imports (tokens such as `psychon/`, `chorai/`, `organa/mcp`, `eidola/`). A single reference document remains explaining what it was and why it was removed (location: `docs/architecture/greek-ecosystem-deprecation.md`).

Abort conditions (Part 2 execution):

- Export parity diff non‑empty.
- Collision during migration.
- Idempotency re‑run produces planned operations.
- New boundary lint failures after duplication/activation.

---

## 10. Grounding & Core References

- Read and follow `GO.md` (primary operational guidance: grounding, TODO structuring, quality gates, deep thinking). For this plan and future sub‑plans, replace any “review agent” mentions with self‑reviews.
- Read `.agent/directives-and-memory/AGENT.md` and linked documents; align behaviour accordingly.
- High‑level context: `.agent/plans/standardising-architecture-high-level-plan.md`
- Part 1 plan: `.agent/plans/standardising-architecture-part1.md`

Terminology note: Chōra (singular) and Chōrai (plural) in prose; use ASCII `chorai` in path segments.

---

## 11. Phased Execution Plan (Concise)

1. Baseline capture for Part 2 (PARTIAL COMPLETE)

- Inventory existing detection logic and provider‑specific code paths. (COMPLETE)
- Snapshot current lint boundary config intended for Part 2 strictness. (COMPLETE)

2. Core extraction and publish (internal)

- Extract interfaces and pure utilities into `@oaknational/mcp-core`. (IN PROGRESS – MINIMAL CORE CREATED)
- Provide `createRuntime(providers)` factory. (DONE – MINIMAL RETURN OF PROVIDERS)

3. Provider implementations

- Implement Node and Cloudflare providers against the core contracts.
- Ensure contract tests drive implementation.
  - Status: Node provider scaffolded (clock/logger/storage) with unit tests — PASS; Cloudflare provider pending.

4. Configuration introduction

- Define minimal `src/config/runtime.json` schema and ownership. (DONE – FILE ADDED; OWNERSHIP TO SERVER TEAM)
- Replace detection logic with config reading and validation. (DONE – CONFIG READ + MINIMAL VALIDATION IN WIRING)

5. Server DI refactor

- Refactor `src/app/wiring.ts` to assemble runtime via core factory and inject into tools/integrations. (PARTIAL – RUNTIME COMPOSED; injection deferred to avoid behaviour drift)

6. Strict boundary enforcement

- Activate import‑x strict rules and phenotype boundaries.
- Fix violations; ensure alias‑only cross‑boundary usage.

7. Mechanical rename and barrels (RENAME COMPLETE)

- Apply `src/tools/tools` → `src/tools/runtime` rename and update imports. (COMPLETE)
- Rationalise barrels; clarify exported names (e.g., `CoreToolRegistry`). (PARTIAL – REGISTRY RENAMED)

8. Validation & reporting

Appendix: Workspace taxonomy and aliases (Queued mechanical)

- Rename workspace taxonomy (mechanical, tracked separately):
  - `ecosystem/psycha/<server>` → `apps/<server>`
  - `ecosystem/moria/moria-mcp` → `packages/core/mcp-core`
  - `ecosystem/histoi/histos-logger` → `packages/libs/logger`
  - `ecosystem/histoi/histos-transport` → `packages/libs/transport`
  - `ecosystem/histoi/histos-storage` → `packages/libs/storage`
  - `ecosystem/histoi/histos-env` → `packages/libs/env`
  - `ecosystem/histoi/histos-runtime-abstraction` → `packages/libs/runtime`
  - `packages/oak-curriculum-sdk` → `packages/sdks/oak-curriculum-sdk`

- Full quality gates; provider matrix; reports updated.
- Greek ecosystem deprecation reference created and linked; residual token scan confirms only that single reference remains.

- Boundaries: Are core↔provider boundaries enforced (no provider imports in core)? Are alias‑only rules applied?
- Config: Is the schema minimal and documented? Is detection logic fully removed?
- Tests: Do contract tests ensure parity across providers? Are smoke/e2e tests sufficient?
- Rename & barrels: Is the rename mechanical and idempotent? Are barrels clear and collision‑free?
- Quality gates: Are gates run frequently with clear PASS signals?
- Spelling & terminology: British spelling; Chōra/Chōrai vs `chorai` paths.

## 14. Ambiguity Audit

| Potential Ambiguity                         | Resolution                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Where to place `mcp-core` package           | Create under `packages/` with clear ownership and README.           |
| Approved public subpaths for import‑x rules | Document in ESLint config comments and package READMEs.             |
| Timing of `tools/tools` → `tools/runtime`   | Execute in Part 2 per this plan with gates; strictly mechanical.    |
| Config shape and defaults                   | Keep minimal; document ownership and environment selection clearly. |

---

## 15. Rollback Strategy

Part 2 should be delivered via small, reviewable commits grouped by phase. If a combined commit is used, maintain a branch that can be reverted as a unit. Where renames are involved, prefer `git mv` to preserve history.
