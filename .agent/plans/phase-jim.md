# Phase Jim

- [x] Create a report on which parts of the codebase are generic to "Oak MCP Servers" and which are specific to the "Oak Notion MCP Server", and begin to define domain boundaries between the two, with the goal of eventual extraction of the generic code into a shared library.
- [x] Identify all uses of Node specific APIs, and group them, to enable definition of an edge-compatible core API surface, with Node extensions for Node-specific use cases.
- [x] See if this repo is small enough that type-enabled linting can be enabled without making linting take too long for git hooks. -- it's borderline too slow, but acceptable for the extra issues and bad patterns it catches at check time.
- [x] Add plans to define boundaries between external systems (Notion), and our code. Make that boundary explicit and simple. Use Notion types and typeguards/predicates at that boundary to properly validate the data, we will use the same types in our codebase. Consider using Zod schemas to validate incoming data, but do not create new types where the Notion SDK types are already available.
- [ ] Add Claude custom commands for quality gates, stepping back, commit and push
- [ ] Add mutation testing to the test suite
