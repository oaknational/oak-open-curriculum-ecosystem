# Oak MCP Ecosystem

**Infrastructure for AI agents to access, understand, and use Oak's openly-licensed, fully-sequenced and resourced curriculum — SDKs, MCP servers, and Elasticsearch-serverless--backed semantic search, all generated from the Oak Open Curriculum OpenAPI specification and the open API and bulk-download data.**

## Vision

[Oak's mission](https://www.thenational.academy/about-us/who-we-are) is to
improve pupil outcomes and close the disadvantage gap by supporting teachers to
teach. Oak's open curriculum API provides a major public asset, and this
repository amplifies its impact through AI-native infrastructure: SDKs, MCP
servers, and semantic search.

Today, it is a build-and-delivery pipeline for reliable curriculum access. At
public alpha for MCP Apps extensions, it also becomes a direct interaction
surface for curriculum use within platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

The roadmap includes integration of Oak's wider AI capabilities (including
knowledge graph and pedagogical rigour services), with Aila and this ecosystem as
complementary, mutually reinforcing tracks. See [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)
for the full framing.
The full vision also includes explicit non-goals, capability staging
(Current/Next/Later), and impact measures for investment decisions.

This vision serves two audiences: external developers/edtech teams who want to
know what they can build, and internal stakeholders who need a clear investment
and impact case for Oak.

## What This Is

This monorepo makes the [Oak Open Curriculum](https://open-api.thenational.academy/) accessible to AI agents and searchable for teachers. It contains:

- **A Curriculum SDK** generated at compile time from the Oak Curriculum OpenAPI schema — TypeScript types, Zod validators, MCP tool metadata, search type generators
- **MCP servers** (stdio and HTTP) that expose the full curriculum to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol
- **A semantic search system** with 4-way Reciprocal Rank Fusion hybrid search (BM25 + ELSER) across 7 Elasticsearch Serverless indices, covering lessons, units, curriculum threads, and subject-phase sequences
- **Core packages** (`Result<T, E>`, environment resolution pipeline) and a **logging library**

### The Open Curriculum

The [Oak Open Curriculum API](https://open-api.thenational.academy/) provides a subset of Oak's curriculum data — specifically the content that is openly licensed and free of third-party copyright. Unlike the data behind [www.thenational.academy](https://www.thenational.academy/), the Open Curriculum is organised to support reuse: by developers, AI agents, and anyone building on Oak's curriculum.

Everything in this repository works with the Open Curriculum API. When you see "curriculum" in the codebase, it means the open, reusable subset.

### The Architectural Foundation

Everything flows from the OpenAPI schema:

1. **OpenAPI Schema** (single source of truth)
2. **→ TypeScript SDK** (generated at `pnpm type-gen`)
3. **→ MCP Tools** (generated from the same schema)
4. **→ Type-safe everything** (no manual type definitions, no runtime assertions)

**The Cardinal Rule**: If the OpenAPI schema changes, running `pnpm type-gen` updates the SDK, types, validators, and MCP tools automatically. Zero manual intervention.

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) define how the system should work and are the architectural source of truth.
Start with the [ADR index](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/), then the foundational ADRs:

- [ADR-029](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/029-no-manual-api-data.md) - No manual API data structures
- [ADR-030](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/030-sdk-single-source-truth.md) - SDK as single source of truth
- [ADR-031](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/031-generation-time-extraction.md) - Generation-time extraction
- [ADR-048](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/048-shared-parse-schema-helper.md) - Shared parsing helper pattern

Architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs in [docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/). Key ADRs include schema-first generation ([ADR-029](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/029-no-manual-api-data.md)), ELSER-only search embeddings ([ADR-076](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/076-elser-only-embedding-strategy.md)), and the deterministic SDK / NL-in-MCP boundary ([ADR-107](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/107-deterministic-sdk-nl-in-mcp-boundary.md)).

## Quick Start

1. **Clone & install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oaknational/oak-mcp-ecosystem.git
   cd oak-mcp-ecosystem
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Read the onboarding guide** – [docs/development/onboarding.md](docs/development/onboarding.md) is the human contributor onboarding path (junior-to-mid-level friendly), with key READMEs, directives, and a lightweight ADR path.

   For AI agents, onboarding starts with `start-right`:
   [command](.cursor/commands/jc-start-right.md), [prompt](.agent/prompts/start-right.prompt.md), or [skill](.agent/skills/start-right/SKILL.md), then [AGENT.md](.agent/directives/AGENT.md).

3. **Verify your local setup (no API keys required)**

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   pnpm type-check
   pnpm lint:fix
   ```

   If these pass, your toolchain is working and you can start contributing to SDK/docs work immediately.

4. **Configure environment variables** (only if your task needs external services)

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # populate OAK_API_KEY, ELASTICSEARCH_*, SEARCH_API_KEY, etc.
   ```

   `.env` and `.env.local` are local-only and are ignored by git.
   Keep `*.env` and `*.env.local` out of version control and use
   placeholders in `.env.example`.

   Each workspace README provides its own `.env.local` hints.

   > **Note**: Many development tasks work without environment variables:
   >
   > - `pnpm test` (unit tests)
   > - `pnpm type-check` (type checking)
   > - `pnpm lint:fix` (linting and autofix)
   > - `pnpm build` (SDK and library builds)
   >
   > Environment variables are only required for:
   >
   > - Running dev servers (`pnpm dev`)
   > - Integration/E2E tests (`pnpm test:e2e`)
   > - Smoke tests (`pnpm smoke:dev:stub`)

5. **Regenerate types & run quality gates**

   ```bash
   pnpm make   # install -> build (includes type-gen via Turbo deps) -> type-check -> doc-gen -> lint:fix -> markdownlint:root -> format:root
   pnpm qg     # full gate: format-check:root -> markdownlint-check:root -> type-check -> lint -> test suites -> smoke
   ```

   `pnpm make` is the recommended first full pipeline run.
   `pnpm qg` is slower and runs UI/E2E/smoke suites that may require additional service configuration.
   For current caveats, see [docs/development/onboarding.md](docs/development/onboarding.md).

6. **Choose your starting point**

   **For SDK/Library contributors** (no env vars needed):
   - Start with `packages/sdks/oak-curriculum-sdk/README.md` – SDK generation, MCP tool generation, shared parsing helpers
   - Work on type generation scripts, runtime clients, or validation helpers

   **For search application contributors** (requires Elasticsearch + API keys):
   - Start with `apps/oak-search-cli/README.md` – hybrid search, admin endpoints, telemetry
   - Requires: `OAK_API_KEY`, `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`, `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`

   **For MCP server contributors** (requires OAK_API_KEY minimum):
   - Stdio: `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-stdio/README.md` – for Claude Desktop, Cursor
   - HTTP: `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/README.md` – OAuth-enabled, Vercel-ready
   - Both import generated tools from the SDK - no manual tool definitions

## Key Commands (root)

```bash
pnpm install        # Install dependencies
pnpm type-gen       # Regenerate SDK + MCP artefacts from OpenAPI
pnpm build          # Build all workspaces
pnpm type-check     # Type-check apps and packages
pnpm doc-gen        # Generate TypeDoc/OpenAPI/markdown/AI docs
pnpm secrets:scan:all # Run secret scan (branches + tags + full history)
pnpm lint:fix       # Lint and auto-fix where possible
pnpm test           # Run unit + integration tests
pnpm test:ui        # Run Playwright suites
pnpm test:e2e       # Run end-to-end tests
pnpm smoke:dev:stub # Local smoke harness for MCP servers
pnpm make           # Full pipeline (install -> build/type-gen -> docs -> lint:fix -> markdownlint:root -> format:root)
pnpm qg             # Quality gate (format-check:root -> markdownlint-check:root -> type-check -> lint -> tests -> smoke)
```

## Type Safety & Validation

- The SDK emits generated Zod schemas for curriculum responses, search responses, and request parameter maps.
- `parseSchema`, `parseWithCurriculumSchema`, `parseEndpointParameters`, and `parseSearchResponse` wrap `schema.safeParse`, returning typed `ValidationResult` objects without manual assertions.
- MCP servers, the search system, and admin tooling import these helpers — no consumer duplicates schema knowledge ([ADR-048](docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/048-shared-parse-schema-helper.md)).

## Documentation & Onboarding

- [docs/development/onboarding.md](docs/development/onboarding.md) – first-stop checklist for new developers and AI assistants.
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) – architecture and development index.
- Workspace READMEs (SDK + Semantic Search) explain local setup, admin workflows, and validation flow.

## Agentic Engineering Practice

This repository is governed by an **agentic engineering practice** — a self-reinforcing system of principles, structures, specialist reviewers, and tooling that creates a safe environment for human-AI collaboration. The practice is what produces the product code; it is not the product code itself.

The practice operates in three layers: **philosophy** (the First Question, metacognition, the learning loop), **structure** (directives, plans, templates, ADRs, sub-agents, quality gates, institutional memory), and **tooling** (platform-specific bindings in `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/commands/`, `.cursor/agents/`).

The entry point is [`.agent/directives/AGENT.md`](.agent/directives/AGENT.md) — follow the links from there and the practice reveals itself. For a map of the whole system, see [`.agent/directives/practice.md`](.agent/directives/practice.md).
